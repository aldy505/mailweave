# Mailweave Improvement Tasks

This document contains a detailed list of actionable improvement tasks for the Mailweave project. Each task is logically ordered and covers both architectural and code-level improvements.

## Backend Architecture

5. [ ] Design and implement a proper database schema for storing DMARC and TLS-RPT reports
6. [ ] Add database migrations system for schema versioning
7. [ ] Implement a proper middleware chain for HTTP handlers (authentication, logging, etc.)
8. [ ] Create a structured API response format with proper error handling

## DMARC Processing

9. [ ] Enhance DMARC parser to handle compressed reports (similar to TLS-RPT parser)
10. [ ] Add support for more DMARC report formats and edge cases
11. [ ] Implement validation for DMARC reports to ensure data integrity
12. [ ] Create a service layer for processing and storing DMARC reports
13. [ ] Add functionality to aggregate DMARC report data for analysis
14. [ ] Implement DMARC policy evaluation logic

## TLS-RPT Processing

15. [ ] Add support for more TLS-RPT report formats and edge cases
16. [ ] Implement validation for TLS-RPT reports to ensure data integrity
17. [ ] Create a service layer for processing and storing TLS-RPT reports
18. [ ] Add functionality to aggregate TLS-RPT report data for analysis

## Email Integration

19. [ ] Implement POP3 client for fetching email reports
20. [ ] Implement IMAP client for fetching email reports
21. [ ] Create a scheduler for periodically checking email for new reports
22. [ ] Add email parsing logic to extract and identify DMARC and TLS-RPT reports
23. [ ] Implement SMTP client for sending digest emails and notifications

## Frontend Implementation

24. [ ] Design a comprehensive UI/UX for the application
25. [ ] Implement authentication and authorization in the frontend
26. [ ] Create dashboard components for visualizing DMARC and TLS-RPT data
27. [ ] Implement data filtering and search functionality
28. [ ] Add responsive design for mobile and tablet devices
29. [ ] Implement proper error handling and loading states
30. [ ] Create a component library for consistent UI elements
31. [ ] Add internationalization (i18n) support

## Testing

32. [ ] Increase test coverage for DMARC parser (currently only tests Google reports)
33. [ ] Add more test cases for TLS-RPT parser
34. [ ] Implement integration tests for database operations
35. [ ] Add end-to-end tests for API endpoints
36. [ ] Implement frontend unit tests for React components
37. [ ] Create mock services for testing email integration

## Documentation

38. [ ] Add comprehensive API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger
39. [ ] Create detailed setup and configuration documentation
40. [ ] Document database schema and relationships
41. [ ] Add code comments explaining complex logic
42. [ ] Create user documentation for the frontend application
43. [ ] Document deployment procedures for different environments

## Performance Optimization

44. [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed data
45. [ ] Optimize database queries with proper indexing
46. [ ] Add pagination for large data sets
47. [ ] Implement efficient data aggregation for reports
48. [ ] Optimize frontend bundle size
49. [ ] Add performance monitoring and profiling

## Security

50. [ ] Implement proper authentication and authorization system
51. [ ] Add input validation for all API endpoints
